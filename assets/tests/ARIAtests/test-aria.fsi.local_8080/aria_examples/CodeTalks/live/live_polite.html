Summary: The region is marked as polite, therefore the changes should be announced after users have completed their current activity. This is higher priority than "off", but it is lower priority than "assertive"</p>
<p>
Description of the expected behavior: After presenting the heading, the user agent should present the text in the live region area at the time. It should then proceed to the "Summary" section followed by the "Description of expected behavior" section. It should then continue to read the filler text until the end of the document and stop. Since there is no more user activity at this point, the current text in the live region area should be announced. In addition, if the user were reading and stopping intermittently, then when the user is idling, the current text in the live region area should be announced.

<p>
The filler text is here to let developers run their user agents for a longer period of time to make sure that everything will continue to behave as it should.
